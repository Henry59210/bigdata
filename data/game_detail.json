Set during 1913-1920, the years of World War 1, and it features varied steam locomotive operations during the period of the Canadian Red and WW1 Red liveries.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough World War 1 raged on in Europe, Melbourne and in turn the Victorian Railways continued expanding, with steam hauled suburban services operating to Lilydale, as evidenced by the new expanded station and yard at Lilydale, constructed in 1913 in preparation for the electrification of the line. The Healesville line itself provided essential supplies to Melbourne in the form of sawn timber from the sawmills around Healesville, Yarra Glen, Lilydale, and from along the Warburton branch (only a short section is modelled).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis line features changing grades, the famous 'Tunnel Hill' tunnel and many bridges. Some of the highlights along the line include the Cave Hill quarry; the Tunnel Hill tunnel, and the 1.5 mile long bridge over the Yarra Flats floodplain and Yarra River near the township of Yarra Glen.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis pack features a range of new locomotives and rolling stock in period colours from ZecRail, utilising full PBR materials, and with a range of ZecRail's standard scripted features:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*VR DD Class Type 4 - Baldwin Built<br />\r\n*VR V class - Phoenix Foundry Built<br />\r\n*VR DogBox steam hauled passenger cars (AC, A, AB, B, and BC classes)<br />\r\n*VR C guards van<br />\r\n*All new VR Z guards van<br />\r\n*VR L sheep van<br />\r\n*VR M timber cattle wagons<br />\r\n*VR N ballast wagons, and ballast plow<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBoth locomotives feature a range of features, including texture swapping, animated couplers, optional marker lamps, and more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe DogBox carriages, C guards van, and Z guards van all feature interior light effects, which can be turned on and off via the 'set interior lights' driver command, or via an option in the Properties menu.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe VR L sheep and M cattle wagons feature random sound effects when loaded.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOver a series of 5 sessions (plus an introduction version of session 1), you will drive a variety of services using these locomotives and wagons between Lilydale and Healesville, with varying weather/environment conditions in each session:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n01 - Down Passenger Service: Drive a Melbourne to Healesville passenger train from just before Mooroolbark to Healesville<br />\r\n<br />\r\n02 - Up Timber Train: Drive an up special goods, hauling sawn timber toward Melbourne, from Healesville in early morning sun on a hot summer day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n03 - Down Mixed: Drive the morning mixed from Lilydale to Healesville on a cold overcast day. A mixed train consists of both passenger and goods, and this train will require shunting at all stations along the way.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n04 - Up Mixed: Drive the up mixed from Healesville to Lilydale, then as a goods from Lilydale toward Melbourne, on a cool clear night.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n05 - Yarra Glen Race Train: Drive a regular suburban service to Lilydale, then forming a race special to Yarra Glen and then back to Lilydale, on a clear spring day.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso included is a multipalyer free play session with trains placed at Healesville, Lilydale, and the Melbourne and Warburton staging yards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n*Note, this DLC pack is a separate release to the TANE Healesville route, due to the large number of changes and new assets created for the TRS19 version of Healesville.", "short_description": "Drive classic Victorian Railways steam locomotives through the famed Yarra Valley, north east of Melbourne, during the WW1 era.

The informant has managed to gain access to schematics of classified naval ships, including those of the Colonial Navy.

While dealings with such organizations is usually the purview of criminal enterprises, the Dominion high council has given you complete autonomy to ensure victory for the Dominion by any means.<br><br>As a specialized branch of the Galactic Imperial forces, the Colonial Navy operated exclusively in the outer rim territories. Their task was to provide security and maintain order in the developing regions of the galaxy. Seeing how matters of the outer rim were of little concern to the prosperous central regions of the Empire, the Colonial Navy acted independently of the Imperial Regulars, with it's own separate command and support infrastructure. But with the ever growing shortages of vital resources, and the Empire's subsequent proclamation to abandon the outer rim altogether, the colonies have now been left to fend for themselves. The withdrawal of the Colonial Navy in it's entirety, has completely overwhelmed the capabilities of sector police forces, threatening a total regression of all the progress that has been made throughout the outer rim colonies.<br><br>The ships of the Colonial Navy are built for self sufficiency and prolonged deployment in the deepest recesses of the galaxy. While being less costly to develop and maintain, they are still formidable and versatile naval ships. Capable of dealing with both a wide variety of enemy ships, and the ability to engage large numbers of hostile targets simultaneously.

Puka loves all things retro, be it old manga or video games. She usually can be seen slacking off instead of working properly.<br>Puka is definitely the goofball of the group. Her odd mannerisms and her love for anime make her a great friend to have around.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1810000/extras/onizuka.png?t=1675283537\" /><br>This huge and intimidating man has a heart of gold. Recently he managed to fail his college entry exams and now has to get by with some odd jobs. Not many people can see past his rough exterior, but those who do will find a lifelong friend.<br>Alize gave him a chance by offering him a part-time job in the Kazoku Mart.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1810000/extras/Uehasu.png?t=1675283537\" /><br>A high school girl.

Her aura practically oozes &quot;High society&quot;, but her background is unknown. Currently, she's visiting a relative in town, but everything - aside from her slightly goofy streak - is shrouded in mystery.<br>Rurika is oddly knowledgeable about tea... and hard liquor.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1810000/extras/tanaka.png?t=1675283537\" /><br>The team leader and &quot;Senpai&quot; of Kureha and Puka. Egocentrical and abusive. Do not engage! Aside from that, he seems surprisingly diligent and proper, if he is not abusing his kouhais, that is.<br>Most people just see him as a bully, but maybe there's more beneath the surface. Probably not.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1810000/extras/alize.png?t=1675283537\" /><br>The totes kewl trendy gal from the local supermarket.
