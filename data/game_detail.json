You have a story to tell, and to do so, you must wear many hats. You're a storyteller, a world builder, a referee and more. While certainly a challenge, your job can be incredibly rewarding. There's nothing like looking across the game table at a group of players on the edge of their seats waiting to see what happens next; nothing like listening to them chat excitedly about a plan, wonder aloud what might happen next. On the other hand, there's nothing so nerve-wracking as like the &quot;Dead Air&quot; that comes when you have to constantly look up a particular rule or break the flow of the game to whip up some story element or NPC that is missing from your game. This book is written to help you avoid those types of situations. <br>  <strong> <br> CONTENT OVERVIEW  </strong>  <br>  In this book you'll find an array of elements designed to help you create memorable games in the Interface Zero setting. <br> CHAPTER ONE: BUILDING YOUR CITY <br>  This chapter is all about ways you can create a city. Much of this is accomplished by using trappings to quickly define an area of a city, like suburbs, corporate enclaves, or slums. Similarly, we also look at organizations such as gangs, major corporations, and organized crime rings and give them trappings you can use to define their scope and influence in 2095. <br> CHAPTER TWO: TOOLKITS <br>  Chapter two gives a variety of components you can use to enhance your campaign. You'll find rules for engaging in corporate warfare, extreme weather, lifestyles and more. <br> CHAPTER THREE: PLOT POINT CAMPAIGNS <br>  Chapter three takes a deeper look at the three core campaign themes found in Interface Zero 3.0: The Player's Guide to 2095 and gives you some advice for creating your own. Here, we also introduce our plot point campaigns. Plot point campaigns are a great way to introduce players to the campaign world you have built. Most official Savage Worlds settings have them, and for the first time, Interface Zero 3.0 introduces three plot point campaigns you can play through. <br> CHAPTER FOUR: SAVAGE TALES <br>  Chapter four expands on the plot point campaigns, providing you with a glut of savage tales you can run over the course of a campaign. Adventure generators for each Plot Point Campaign are also provided. <br> CHAPTER FIVE: THREATS <br>  As a GM, you need non-player characters, mooks and other interesting creatures and challenges for your players. Chapter five gives you a bunch of npcs and biohorrors and gives you a biohorror generator and a npc generator you can use to make your own creatures and characters. <br> CHAPTER 6: THE TENDRIL ACCESS PLAGUE <br>  In this chapter, we go into detail on the Tendril Access Plague and its effects on the world. You'll find information about the plague, the Cyber Information Security Section (CISS), IDentification APPlication Software (IDAPPS), as well as rules for dealing with infection, removing the plague from your TAP, and more. <br> CHAPTER SEVEN: 2095 REVISITED <br>  <br>  Chapter six takes a deeper look at the world. The Player's Guide to 2095 provided a wealth of information about the world and the greater solar system. In the GM's Guide to 2095, we take another look at the setting, this time with an eye for elements and plot hooks you can use to create adventures for your players. <br>  <br>   <br> &quot;", "about_the_game": "&quot; <br> <h2 class=\"bb_tag\"> Interface Zero 3.0: The Game Master's Guide to 2095</h2>   The job of the game master can be daunting.

In most players' opinion, it may be called a Turn-Based Tactics game.<br>Such an idea is the singularity of the birth of our very first game FALL OF EARTH. Since the members of our team are players of the X-COM series more or less, we can be sure that the core gameplay of X-COM is extremely interesting \u2014 though the somatosensory of the game can be a little bit hardcore.<br>However, this type of hardcore experience will generally increase the difficulty for players to join us. Based on the intention of hoping we can enjoy the fun of X-COM together with all of you, we made some simplifications and innovations in the early gameplay design of FALL OF EARTH while retaining the key parts of the X-COM game as much as possible.<br>We are mainly working on [free exploration] and [turn-based combat] in our current version though. In the future, we will release the latest content, gameplay and character design as much as possible while ensuring the progress of game development.<br>For this game, as well as our first work, we have our own pursuits in all aspects, such as character creation, plot, art style, music and sound effects.

Gather resources from around the map, construct productions like Blacksmith or Carpenter to craft armour needed by your units. Place your defences to protect your settlement against invading undead.<br><br>But don\u2019t forget to build up lights, as the night approaches, the land gets covered in darkness and undead rise from their graves.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2306730/extras/Darfall_GIF_build_city.gif?t=1681780615\" /><br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2306730/extras/steam_explore_map.png?t=1681780615\" /><br>Darfall: Prologue offers a full day &amp; night cycle, where you explore during the day, but defend during the night. The exploration of your surroundings is an integral part to your survival. Roam freely during the daylight to discover orc encampments guarding their loot, or precious silver veins you can mine from. As the land is infested with undead corruption, you must destroy their hideouts so you can expand your settlement even further.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2306730/extras/Darfall_GIF_explore_the_map.gif?t=1681780615\" /><br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2306730/extras/steam_manage_hero.png?t=1681780615\" /><br>Darfall: Prologue gives you a full hero management gameplay. Loot weapons and armour to equip your hero and make him more powerful. Use the spell book to train new skills that unlock as your hero levels up. From scorching groups of enemies to healing your wounded allies in battle, use and control the abilities in a similar way as in MOBA games.<br>Your hero has a full inventory, which can be filled with materials and resources you gather and collect during your exploration.
